# Problem Solving - Afternoon Lab

1. For this assignment, we'll get back into pairs.
1. Write a program that implements your pseudo coded peanut butter and jelly sandwich process
1. This program should be written in a single js file that is run using node
1. For every step of suedo code, write a function that will `console.log()`what that step does

### Bonus
1. Try to find a way to add a delay between each function call

### Example
```javascript
 const openJamBottle = () => {
    console.log('Opening Jam Bottle');
}

openJamBottle();
```
